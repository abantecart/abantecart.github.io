<img src="/img/other/catelog-product-promo1.png" border="0" />
<ul>
<li>add Special price for this product (click on Add Special button). You can enter a Special Price for this product. In the front-end, this will appear near the original price, which will be crossed out. You can enter a date range within which the Special price will be active. This price will apply automatically when the <em>Date Start</em> arrives and deactivate automatically when the <em>Date End</em> arrives. If you leave this range blank, the Special Price will apply until you remove it.</li>

<p>Discounts/Specials for a customer group will display the special price only if the customer is logged in as that group.</p>
