									<h4 class="step-title">product tax class </h4>
									<div class="step-content"> A product tax class is an identifier that is assigned to a product. This defines the tax class for a product. In most cases, you want to use the default “Taxable Goods” class. If you sell goods that require a different tax class you can add the classes in System > Localization > Tax Classes. For example, a product tax class can be "Taxable Goods" or "None (Tax-free)". </div>

								<li class="step">

									<h4 class="step-title">tax rate</h4>
									<div class="step-content"> A tax rate is a number in percentage or absolute fixed amount, with which taxes are calculated. For example, we can set a tax rate to 8.25% for the sales tax of California.
									Tax Rates control which taxes are applied to specific geographic areas (Locations).   </div>

									<span class="step-number"><i class="fa fa-exclamation fa-fw"></i></span>
									<h4 class="step-title">Location and Location's Zone</h4>
