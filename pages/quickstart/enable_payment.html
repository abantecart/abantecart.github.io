									<div class="step-content"> A product tax class is an identifier that is assigned to a product. This defines the tax class for a product. In most cases, you want to use the default “Taxable Goods” class. If you sell goods that require a different tax class you can add the classes in System > Localization > Tax Classes. For example, a product tax class can be "Taxable Goods" or "None (Tax-free)". </div>
