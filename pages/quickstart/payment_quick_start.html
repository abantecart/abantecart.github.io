							<p>Payment Extensions give the store owner a way to interface with several established companies for credit card processing.<br>
		Every payment method in AbanteCart is presented as Extension and in order to access these you will need to login into the admin area of your installation. Then you should navigate to Extensions > Payments.<br>

This action will install the extension and will lead you to the configuration page for the same where you need to configure additional options.
