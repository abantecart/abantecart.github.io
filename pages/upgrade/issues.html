									<h4 class="step-title">Fix file permissions</h4>

You can change permissions on required files to be writable (777) or just make all files and directories writable for upgrade process. This can be and recommended changed back after upgrade. If you encounter issues or do not feel comfortable with permissions, do manual upgrade in next step instead.  </div>
