<p>Data can be exported from AbanteCart or imported to in XML, CSV and TXT file formats. You can select the database tables that a Export file will contain, depending on the information to be exported. You have the ability to select not only data types like <em>Categories, Customers, Orders</em> but also fill the <strong><em>ID range from -to</em></strong> and sort output data by selecting <em><strong>Sort by</strong></em>Â  drop-down menu to export the necessary ones and not to export all data of the store.</p>
<p><em>Note: For CSV and TXT output file formats you can choose a preferred delimiter symbol: comma, semicolon, TAB symbol. This may be necessary to make sure that the import or export operation works the way that you want it to.</em></p>
