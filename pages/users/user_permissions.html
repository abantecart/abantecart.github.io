							<p>For each one of the administrator user groups you can specify which areas of the Administration Panel they will be allowed to go see and modify. For example, you may have a login created for your Webmaster and you need to restrict them from accessing your customer's information. Alternately, you may want your sales staff to have access to customers and orders, but not to design aspects of the site. </p>
