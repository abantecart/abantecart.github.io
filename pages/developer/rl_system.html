	AbanteCart equipped with flexible and convenient way to store, manage and map media resources. System can handle media files or any other files or HTML codes that needs too have association to product, category, brand or any other data resource in the application. Simple example of the resource is image that can be mapped to one or many products or categories.<br>
Resource library can handle files or HTML/Javascript codes that can be uploaded in case of file or saved in case of the code. Uploaded files are automatically processed to create thumbnails.<br>
Multiple resource types provide ability to distinct resources for different MIME types or application use.

	<h4 id="Disadvantages" class="box-title">Disadvantages</h4>
	<p class="box-description">
We do not see much of disadvantage, only inconvenience of non-conventional storage of files in the directory with no human readability. Files are stored in optimized form similar to iTunes way storing music files. To solve this inconvenience, we will have import export tools to transform the files.
