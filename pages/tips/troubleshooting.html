    	<div class="list-item-content"> Mod_security is an apache module that helps to protect your website from various attacks.
        mod_security has certain rules for the words "pattern" used in requested URL's.
        If any pattern match with the requested URL under your site mod_security false positive and deny the access to it. 
        Many people are experiencing problems because of this. Problems include "403", "500" or access denied errors (forbidden access), login problems, and similar.
        Ask your hosting support to disable individual mod_security rules or try to disable it manually. <b>We strongly recommend you contact your hosting provider and work with them to resolve the server issue. </b>

    	<div class="list-item-content"> If you're making changes to the static content cached with CDN on your site, including changes to JavaScript, CSS or images, it can be very easy to forget that you need to purge CDN cache. The content delivery network “CDN”  (Cloudflare, MaxCDN) will deliver cached images and other bits of your website to your visitors from one of the several data-centers located around the world instead of from your webserver. Some minifications and asynchronous loading added by CDN can break your webpages. 
        <br/>
        To resolve issues purge all CDN cache in the CDN admin panel and try to set caching level to cache static content only: images and css.
        Make sure you have disabled javascript and css Auto Minify.

        Session_save_path is a PHP variable that is set in php.ini, and on many shared hosting setups it’s actually set to a location that’s not writable.

        Contact your host to solve this.
