						<p>AbanteCart has multi-store abilities which allow you to manage multiple stores from one admin interface.</p>
<p>There are many advantages in being able to set up multiple stores:</p>

<ul>
<li>Theme each store differently to match the products that are being sold.</li>
<li>Set products to a appear on specific stores.</li>
<li>Localize each store by setting a different default language, <a class="crosslink" href="/pages/localization/currencies/currencies.html" target="_blank">currency</a> and <a class="crosslink" href="/pages/quickstart/setup_taxes.html" target="_blank">tax class</a>.</li>
<li>Setup a default <a class="crosslink" href="/pages/customers/groups.html" target="_blank">customer group</a> for each store allowing you to have some stores setup for retail customers and others as wholesale.</li>
</ul>
