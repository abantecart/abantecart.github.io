							<h3 class="category-title">AbanteCart multi-store</h3>
							<h4 class="category-description"> AbanteCart has multi-store abilities which allow you to manage multiple stores from one admin interface.</h4>
						</div>
<p>To setup multi-store first of all setup your main store with main domain name.</p>
<p>if You need to create multistore you DON’T NEED to install cart again or anything do with files. Only you need is two things:<br /> 1. setup additional domain (addon domain) or subdomain in your hosting provider admin panel<br /> 2. set up second store in the admin of main store. At the end you should have 1 cart admin and 2 (or more) storefronts <br /> Please note: the first step is not AbanteCart related. If you have problems please contact with your hosting provider.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="heading_gray">set up your hosting Cpanel</p>

<p>Set up two or more domains in your hosting service control panel. This is very important to make sure that the second domain is routed to the correct folder.</p>
<p>There is several ways in Cpanel - subdomain or addon domain.</p>







<h3 class="heading_gray"><img src="/img/other/toggle-collapse.png" border="0" /> Here is short example for subdomain way</h3>
<p>In your Cpanel click on subdomains icon</p>
<img src="/img/other/abantecart-multistore-cpanel1.png" border="0" width="501" />
<p>Create a subdomain</p>
<img src="/img/other/abantecart-multistore-cpanel2.png" border="0" width="736" />
<p>Note: very important - Document Root value should be same with main domain!!! If you have AbanteCart installed in some folder for example /public_html/somefolder/mycartfolder/ subdomain Root should be the same. Also a lot of other problems here not AbanteCart related:<br />• some hosting provider limit or don't allow subdomains<br />• if you are using a content delivery network you should edit A record in DNS zone editor manually and/or modify additional settings</p>
<p> </p>




<p>Anyway a lot of beginners have issues here because:<br /> • Due to DNS propagation, the subdomain can take up to 24 hours and more to start working</p>
<p>• make sure to link the subdomain to the path where the default store was installed to</p>
<p>• make sure there is no redirection setup for new subdomain/domain</p>
<p>• usually user may need to clear browser cache and DNS cache on local computer to resolve new or reconfigured domains/subdomains</p>
<p>• also possible some settings in .htacess file or file permissions issue prevent correct work </p>
<p>Please contact with your hosting service provider to make sure your domain/subdomain configured correctly</p>

<p class="heading_gray">set up your AbanteCart admin panel</p>

<p>in AbanteCart admin go to System » Settings</p>
<p>click on <strong>Create New Store</strong> button</p>
<br /><a class="jcepopup" href="/img/other/multistore1.png"><img src="/img/other/multistore1.png" border="0" width="400" /></a>
<p> </p>
<p>fill in the at least following fields:</p>

<p><strong>Store Name:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Store URL:</strong> Include the full URL to your store. Make sure to add '/' at the end. Example: http://www.second.yourdomain.com/store/</p>

<a class="jcepopup" href="/img/other/multistore2.png"><img src="/img/other/multistore2.png" border="0" width="400" /></a>
<p>Starting from AbanteCart v1.1.0 you able to copy all setting from already created store. At least from your default store.</p>
