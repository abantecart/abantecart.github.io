							<p class="note-description"> To find the specific php value, search the page for what you're looking for. In this case, we used our browser's search feature ( Ctrl + f ) and searched for memory_limit. The first value you see is what is set for the current directory (local value), and the setting value is the master value. The local value is the actual setting and is the important value, because the local values will override the master value. </p>
