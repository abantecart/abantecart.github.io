<p>The AbanteCart software includes an order management system that features automatic e-mails to customers and merchants. Orders are created when a customer completes the checkout process and are visible by Admin users only. Each order is given a unique Order ID stored in the database.<br>
An order also has a status. The order statuses let you know how far along the order is, starting from pending and ending with complete. You can create your own order statuses in the Admin > System > Localization > <a href="/pages/localization/statuses/order_status_list.html">Order Statuses</a>. Also you can assign any order status to be default for specific <a href="/pages/ship_and_pay/enable_payment.html">Payment Method</a>.</p>

<div class="padding">
<p>- Order ID;</p>
<p>- Customer Name - customer's name;</p>
<p>- Total - order total;</p>
</div>
