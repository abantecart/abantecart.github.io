    <h3 class="category-title">Evaluation of AbanteCart is even easier now. </h3>
    <h4 class="category-description">AbanteCart is freely available as a source code download, virtual appliance, and as part of virtual machine. This helps great deal with starting ecommerce fast, however, some installation is required and in case of server installation, hosting and domain name is required.</h4>
    <p>But, what if you just want to try AbanteCart quick and play with features? Sure thing, you can use online demo, but it is shared with everyone and reset every 30 minutes. Shared demo does not give a lot of freedom to see all great features in AbanteCart and start building your site.<br>

Now this is possible. Anyone can create a personal trial store to test features of AbanteCart and even start building ecommerce site. No need to install anything, no need for domain or hosting, no personal information is asked and no credit cards required.</p>
