							<p class="note-description"> Recommended that you DO NOT upgrade AbanteCart on live site. Depending on your server or OS configuration upgrades might not go all the way through and you will need more time for manual upgrade. We suggest you upgrade your test site first and always create backups.<br>
Upgrades are available only from prior version to next. If you do not upgrade for long time, you will need to run all upgrades in between.<br>
If you are made Core modifications in any of the files that changed, they may need to be redone.
